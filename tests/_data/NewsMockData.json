This reflects a slight widening of the average net initial yield from 5.27% at September 30 to 5.45% at December 31, due to the broader macro-economic environment. Additionally, Civitas says the decrease is due to the \u2018effects of the mark-to-market valuations of the company\u2019s financial swaps and caps\u2019.

The CAC 40 index in Paris was up 0.4%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt surged 0.8%.</p><p>The dollar was returning some of its post-US jobs report gains. </p><p>Sterling was quoted at $1.2096 midday Wednesday, up from $1.2015 at the London equities close on Tuesday. The euro traded at $1.0744, up from $1.0700. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at JP\u00a5130.67, down from JP\u00a5131.17.</p><p>Analysts at Lloyds Bank commented: \u2018Powell in an interview largely repeated his comments of last week that interest rates have further to rise. However, markets seemed relieved that he was not more hawkish in the wake of last Friday\u2019s very strong employment report.\u2019</p><p>Speaking at The Economic Club of Washington, the Fed chair said the US central bank will need to keep raising interest rates.</p><p>\u2018We think that we\u2019ll need to do further rate increases and we think we will need to hold policy at a restricted level for some time,\u2019 Powell said, echoing his language at a press conference last week.</p><p>When asked on Tuesday whether the Fed would have still lifted rates by 25 basis points had members known about Friday\u2019s strong US jobs data, Powell said: \u2018We didn\u2019t expect it to be this strong but I would say it kind of shows you why we think this will be a process that takes a significant period of time.\u2019</p><p>There is one more US jobs report before the Fed\u2019s next interest rate decision. The Federal Open Market Committee next meets on March 21, before it decides on rates a day later. </p><p>Should the jobs report that precedes this come in hotter-than-expected, like last week\u2019s, markets could be spooked once more. </p><p>At this early stage, there is a 94% chance of another 25 basis point hike by the US central bank next month, according to the CME FedWatch tool. That would take the federal funds rate target range to 4.75% to 5.00%. </p><p>US equities climbed overnight in the wake of Powell\u2019s speech. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.8%, the S&amp;P 500 up 1.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.9%.</p><p>Stocks in New York were called to open lower on Wednesday, however. The Dow and S&amp;P were called 0.3% lower, and the Nasdaq down 0.2%. </p><p>It was a wild ride for US stocks on Tuesday before they eventually ended solidly higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed some 160 points shortly after Powell began speaking. It then shaved around 240 points from its tally inside the next hour of trading, before investor sentiment improved as the afternoon wore on. </p><p>Lifting the market mood in London on Wednesday, the National Institute of Economic &amp; Social Research forecast that the UK will swerve a technical recession this year. A technical recession is defined by two or more quarters in a row of falling gross domestic product. </p><p>This is a more optimistic outlook for the UK economy than that offered by the Bank of England last week, which predicted a shallower but still protracted recession, as well as a recent gloomy prediction from the International Monetary Fund, which predicted Britain to be the only major economy to suffer a contraction this year.</p><p>The better forecast for the local economy lifted retail shares in London. Sports Direct-owner Frasers climbed 2.9%, Next rose 2.4%, and JD Sports added 1.5%. </p><p>The leisure sector also got a boost, Wagamama-owner Restaurant Group rose 4.6%, Grosvenor Casinos-operator Rank was 3.0% higher, and low-cost gym chain Gym Group was up 3.9%. </p><p>Housebuilders were on the up, despite a dividend cut by Barratt Developments. Barratt was up 2.0%, while peers Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey added 2.5% and 1.6%. </p><p>Barratt reported revenue rose 24% annually to \u00a32.78 billion from \u00a32.25 billion in the half-year ended December 31. Pretax profit rose 16% to \u00a3501.5 million from \u00a3432.6 million. </p><p>Barratt said it has seen some \u2018early signs of improvement\u2019 in trading in January. </p><p>\u2018One important area which has improved is the number of reservations per outlet, which in January bounced back somewhat from December lows, though still down markedly year-on-year,\u2019 AJ Bell analyst Russ Mould commented. </p><p>\u2018A slight improvement in the housing market in January has reassured shareholders in Barratt Developments but the company\u2019s decision to cut its dividend suggests it is reacting to new realities.\u2019</p><p>The housebuilder cut its interim dividend to 10.2 pence per share, an 8.9% decrease from 11.2p a year before. It said the payment was in line with its planned reduction in dividend cover to 2.0 times for the full-year from 2.25 times in the first half of financial 2022.</p><p>BP added 2.1% to 527.40 pence. Barclays lifted its price target for the stock by 43% to 1,000p from 700p. BP had jumped 8.0% on Tuesday, after announcing a share buyback and surging annual profit. </p><p>On AIM, Xeros fell 7.1%. </p><p>The developer of laundry technology, that reduces water use, warned its annual loss before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation will be worse than expected. The Ebitda loss will be 5% to 10% higher than previously forecast due to the timing of milestone payments and the cost of some restructuring work. </p><p>Gold was quoted at $1,880.47 an ounce early Wednesday afternoon, up from $1,875.35 on Tuesday. Brent oil was trading at $84.15 a barrel on Wednesday afternoon, rising from $82.75 late Tuesday. </p><p>Still to come on Wednesday, there are first-quarter results from entertainment company Walt Disney, due after the closing bell in New York.  </p><p>Copyright 2023 Alliance News Ltd.

In the quarter ending December 31, the healthcare real estate investment trust says its rent roll increased with inflation, and lease billings continue to reflect consumer price index inflation increases. The trust raises its third quarterly dividend to 1.425p, targeting a total annual payout of 5.70p, rising from 5.55p in the previous financial year. Civitas notes strong demand and decreasing supply within the specialist housing sector. However, net asset value per share at the end of the period falls 3.4% to 110.93p from 114.84p at the end of September. </p><p>----------</p><p>SMALL-CAP - LOSERS</p><p>----------</p><p>Speedy Hire PLC, down 9.9% at 37.82p, 12-month range 35.5p-58p. The tool and equipment hire services company says a count for its 2023 audit identified a \u00a320.4 million deficiency in the value of its non-itemised assets. Back at the end of March, its total hire equipment assets were worth \u00a3226.9 million, of which non-itemised assets made up \u00a349.9 million. It has launched an external investigation into the issue, and the deficiency is expected to be recorded as a one-off non-cash write down in its balance sheet for the year ending March 31. It also says it has closed 20 depots at the end of January, which will cost around \u00a32.9 million. This is part of its transition towards a large, more energy-efficient low-carbon depot network. \u2018The associated benefits are expected to be in the region of \u00a32.9 million per annum,\u2019 the firm says. </p><p>----------</p><p>Copyright 2023 Alliance News Ltd.

We have reason to believe the worst is behind us and that a repeat of the events that plagued market sentiment in 2022 is unlikely.

The index is up 4.9% so far in 2023.</p><p>The FTSE 250 index was up 161.68 points, 0.8%, at 20,350.68, and the AIM All-Share was up 2.51 points, 0.3%, at 881.64. </p><p>The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.6% at 791.11, the Cboe UK 250 was up 0.8% at 17,749.28, and the Cboe Small Companies was down 0.5% at 14,099.25. </p><p>European equities were similarly upbeat, with the CAC 40 index in Paris up 0.7%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was up 0.5%.</p><p>Markets were following a lead from a rally on Wall Street on Tuesday, following a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. </p><p>Powell, speaking at The Economic Club of Washington, reasserted that the US central bank will need to keep raising interest rates.</p><p>\u2018We think that we\u2019ll need to do further rate increases and we think we will need to hold policy at a restricted level for some time,\u2019 Powell said, echoing his language at a press conference last week.</p><p>When asked on Tuesday whether the Fed would have still lifted rates by 25 basis points had members known about Friday\u2019s strong US jobs data, Powell said: \u2018We didn\u2019t expect it to be this strong but I would say it kind of shows you why we think this will be a process that takes a significant period of time.\u2019</p><p>Despite the firm words, equity market investors saw the positive in Powell\u2019s remarks.</p><p>Wall Street finished higher after the Powell talk, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending up 0.8%, the S&amp;P 500 up 1.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.9%.</p><p>The dollar was weaker early Wednesday in London. </p><p>Sterling was quoted at $1.2085, higher than $1.2015 at the London equities close on Tuesday.

Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at JP\u00a5130.97, down from JP\u00a5131.17.</p><p>Sentiment in the UK also was lifted by a more upbeat economic forecast for the country\u2019s economy. </p><p>The National Institute of Economic &amp; Social Research has forecast that the UK will swerve a technical recession \u0096 as defined by two or more quarters of falling gross domestic product in a row \u0096 not just in the final three months of 2022, but also throughout 2023.</p><p>It is a more optimistic outlook for the UK economy than that offered by the Bank of England last week, which predicted a shallower but still protracted recession, as well as a recent gloomy prediction from the International Monetary Fund, which saw Britain being the only major economy to suffer a contraction this year.</p><p>But that is largely where the optimism ends, with NIESR warning in its latest report that it will \u2018certainly feel like a recession\u2019, with real personal disposable income having contracted for four consecutive quarters.</p><p>The FTSE 100 was lifted to its record high by share price gains for some of its biggest constituents.

Total home completions rose 6.9% to 8,626. Barratt said the strong half-year was due to its \u2018significant\u2019 forward order book at the end of June. However, it has seen lower reservation rates for future sales in the new financial year, particular in the second quarter. </p><p>\u2018Whilst we have seen some early signs of improvement in current trading during January, we will need to see continued momentum over the coming months before we can be confident that these challenging trading conditions are easing,\u2019 Barratt said. </p><p>Davy Research said the results were in line with market expectations. \u2018Despite sales continuing to be very sluggish in early H2, the company will still deliver a satisfactory volume outturn in FY23,\u2019 the Dublin-based broker said.</p><p>JD Sports added 1.4% as it said it has completed the divestment of some brands to Frasers Group, namely, the businesses which trade as Tessuti (including Xile), Scotts, Choice, Giulio and Cricket, but noted Rascal Clothing Ltd will no longer be part of the transaction.</p><p>Frasers Group rose 2.0%.</p><p>Smurfit Kappa was the worst blue-chip performer, down 4.3%, despite reporting a \u2018highly successful\u2019 year. </p><p>The Dublin-based packaging maker said pretax profit in 2022 rose 42% to \u20ac1.29 billion from \u20ac913 million in 2021.

The company declared a final dividend of 107.6 euro cents per share, up 12% from 96.1 euro cents a year prior.</p><p>However, Smurfit Kappa noted a slight fall in box volumes, as demand slowed due to inflation. </p><p>\u2018This slowdown was particularly evidenced in the latter part of the year, especially in the month of December, where we saw stock reductions and downtime taken by customers,\u2019 the company said. </p><p>In the FTSE 250 index, PZ Cussons dropped 6.4%. </p><p>In the six months to December 3, the consumer goods and healthcare products firm said revenue rose 19% to \u00a3336.9 million from \u00a3283.7 million a year before, led by the Childs Farm acquisition. </p><p>Pretax profit surged 72% to \u00a340.5 million from \u00a323.5 million. The interim dividend was left unchanged at 2.67p. \u2018We remain mindful of significant macro-economic uncertainty, including the continued depreciation of the Nigerian naira, but expect to report FY23 adjusted profit before tax in line with current market estimates,\u2019 PZ said.</p><p>On AIM, Deltic Energy jumped 19%. </p><p>The North Sea-focused natural resources investor announced a \u2018significant\u2019 gas discovery at Pensacola on licence P2252 in the southern North Sea. </p><p>\u2018Pensacola could represent one of the largest natural gas discoveries in the southern North Sea in over a decade,\u2019 the firm said.</p><p>Its first exploration well points to an estimated ultimate recovery of 302 billion cubic feet. </p><p>In Asia on Wednesday, the Nikkei 225 stock index in Tokyo closed down 0.3%. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 in Sydney closed up 0.4%. In China, the Shanghai Composite lost 0.5%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was down 0.1%.</p><p>Gold was quoted at $1,883.24 an ounce early Wednesday, up from $1,875.35 on Tuesday.

Pretax profit rose 16% to \u00a3501.5 million from \u00a3432.6 million, despite operating margin worsening to 17.8% from 19.3%. </p><p>Total home completions rose 6.9% to 8,626 from 8,067 a year earlier. Barratt said the strong half was due to its \u2018significant\u2019 forward order book at the end of June last year. </p><p>However, it has seen lower reservation rates for future sales in the new financial year, particular in the second quarter. </p><p>Barratt said net private reservations per active outlet per week were 0.49 in January, down 46% from 0.90 in the comparative period last year. This reflects the more \u2018tentative demand seen in the calendar year to date\u2019, it explained. </p><p>Forward sales as at January 29 were 10,854 homes at a value of \u00a32.67 billion.
